export const wyamroDescription = `The objective of the Wyamro Foundation is to bring yoga, naturopathy, and Ayurveda, along with other alternative medicines like acupuncture, homeopathy, etc., to the general public in India.

In modern times, access to healthcare is becoming increasingly distant from the common people. The expensive nature of allopathic medicine, coupled with the overcrowding in government hospitals, makes it challenging for individuals to receive timely and proper treatment. Additionally, changing lifestyles, environmental pollution, and various other factors are leading to a rising prevalence of serious diseases affecting a large number of people.

In such a situation, traditional Indian practices like yoga, Ayurveda, and naturopathy, along with other alternative therapies such as acupuncture and homeopathy, can play a crucial role in maintaining people's health. These alternative medical approaches offer cost-effective treatments that can help people stay healthy.`;
